    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">About Me</h1>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Hi, I’m <strong>Mudiwa Nyikavaranda</strong> — a software engineer passionate about building impactful, 
      user-centered products that solve real-world problems. I specialize in modern web and mobile 
      applications, combining solid backend architecture with beautiful, intuitive frontends.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      My work spans <strong>Flask, PostgreSQL, React, and Flutter</strong>, with a strong focus on security, 
      scalability, and great user experience. I believe great software should not only work but 
      inspire confidence and delight in its users.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      I’m the creator of <strong>Zimora</strong> — a digital rewards platform designed to connect businesses and 
      customers in meaningful ways. I’ve led it from concept to production, covering design, 
      architecture, and deployment.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I’m not coding, I’m exploring emerging tech trends, mentoring junior developers, or 
      brainstorming new product ideas.
